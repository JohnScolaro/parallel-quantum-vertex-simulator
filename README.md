*Parallel Quantum Vertex Simulator*

This is a project to create some well documented code to evolve a 1 dimensional wave-function according to the Schroedinger Equation via a 'Forwards in Time, Central Difference' (FCTS) approach to the Crank-Nicolson method. It utilizes OpenMP to simplify multiprocessing for the Intel Xeon Phi, which should lead to increased computation speeds.
